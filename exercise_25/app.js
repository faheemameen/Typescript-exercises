//Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
//Write an if statement to test whether the alienâ€™s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
var alien_color = "green";
if (alien_color === "green") {
    console.log("Congraatulations!, you just earned 5 points for shooting the alien");
}
